# Social Media Task by R Pretorius

## Assumptions

- Because Morgain Stainley is a high proirity client, I have decided to rather send them no data at all, than to send them half-currupted data which could potentially cause monetary loss, thus only http responses of a 200 code will be seen as a valid data response
- The keyword **"Unavailable"** will be used in the case where the activity count of a given social media can't be retrieved
